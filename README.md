# Drums_Vanilla_JS
JS website to play drums online (v.0.01).

**Message to Future Self**

Hello there!

I've returned to GitHub, shifting my focus from React to learning Angular while juggling my college C++ courses. Reflecting on the past year, I realized my JavaScript skills took a back seat due to my deep dive into Computer Science theory. Now, I'm eager to enhance my practical programming abilities and move away from competitive programming, which dominated my efforts before.

**ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

Having spent over a year immersed in drumming, I've now joined a college band. Lamentably, I lack a drum set at home. That's where this project comes in ‚Äì a virtual drum set on my laptop!

**Project Milestones:**
  
*Version 0.1:*
1) ‚úÖ Basic styling + project skeleton
2) ‚úÖ Keydown event listener + sound implementation
3) ‚úÖ On-click sound functionality
4) ‚úÖ Basic animations

*Future Versions:*
1) Identify optimal and convenient keys for playing + implementation
2) Provide an option for users to customize key mappings
3) Incorporate a metronome
4) Integrate songs (with/without drums) for real-time drumming
5) Develop a user platform with authentication:
   - Private/public songs
   - Allow users to customize their drum set (sounds)

The starting point for this project was drawn from www.javascript30.com. This project is not just a coding exercise; it's a musical journey, and I'm excited to see where it takes me. Here's to drumming up some fantastic code! ü•Å
